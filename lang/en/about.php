        'description' => 'Founded in 1978, the company « International Manufacturers » had for main activity the import – export of all types of goods. Then, the business specialised in the « ready to wear » industry, exporting various textiles. Seeing the limited number of clients, the risk of loosing even one of them would represent a huge danger. It was then, in the early 80’s that the company quickly turned to watchmaking products.
      <br/><br/>
      In the following years, the company formed close ties with suppliers located in Hong-Kong for the import of goods. The commercialization will then grow fast thanks to an efficient and organized family management.
      <br/><br/>
      The company will see its turnover grow up constantly. This evolution is easily explanable thanks to 3 golden rules :
      <br/><br/>
      <ul>
      <li>Provide a Quality Product</li>
      <li>Ensure a fast and efficient after-sale service</li>
      <li>Respect our engagements</li>
      </ul>
      <br/><br/>
      It is in 1994 that International Manufacturers decided to increase its capital and change its name for Cetronic Benelux S.A.',
